⚓ 1. Boat-Specific Data
These define how the specific boat behaves in water.

Boat name / identifier (to look up real-time AIS or historical data)

Boat type (e.g., cargo, sailboat, fishing, military)

Hull type and size (displacement hull, planing hull, length, beam, draft)

Engine type and power (sail, motor, hybrid)

Maximum and current speed

Maneuverability characteristics

Weight / load

Autopilot system or navigation strategy (if known)

🌍 2. Initial State Data
Snapshot of the boat at the current moment.

Current position (latitude, longitude)

Current speed (knots)

Current heading (degrees)

Timestamp of current position

🌊 3. Environmental Conditions
Dynamic and can change rapidly. Must be factored in from reliable real-time or historical sources.

Wind speed and direction

Wave height and direction

Current (oceanic) speed and direction

Tides (level and direction)

Water depth (bathymetry)

Temperature and salinity (may affect buoyancy, especially for submarines or small boats)

Weather systems (e.g., storms, fronts)

🛰️ 6. Data Sources / Integration
To implement this system in real life, you'll need access to:

AIS data feeds (MarineTraffic, AISHub, etc.)

Weather APIs (NOAA, OpenWeatherMap, Windy, etc.)

Ocean current data (HYCOM, Copernicus)

Tide prediction services

Map data and geofencing APIs (Google Maps, OpenSeaMap)
